-The program creates a unique ID by combining the first letter of the user's first name, their lowercase surname, and a randomly generated alphanumeric string. The addAccount function verifies that the first name, last name, email, and age are provided. All fields must be non-empty strings, and the age must be at least 18. If these conditions are met, the user's details, along with the generated ID, are appended to the users.txt file.
